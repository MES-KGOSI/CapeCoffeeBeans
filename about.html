                <p>Cape Coffee Beans is a business dedicated to South African specialty coffee lovers. 
                   We sell everything from artisan-roasted beans to brewing equipment, espresso machines,
                   home roasters, and everything in between. We serve passionate home consumers, as well as
                   businesses that care about coffee. Our mission is to provide everything you need to make,
                   serve and enjoy a delicious cup. On this page, you can learn a little bit more about who we
                   are and our history.</p>

                   <h2>How CCB Started</h2>
                   <p>My name is Phaedon, and I founded Cape Coffee Beans in 2013 after working in technology-focused
                    strategy consulting and South African eCommerce. My growing passion for coffee led me to ask,
                    “why can’t I buy a good selection of freshly roasted beans online?” What began as a weekend project
                    quickly grew into a side business and eventually my full-time venture. While the original idea was
                    to sell beans only, I soon realised customers also needed grinders and brewing equipment. By expanding
                    into all things specialty coffee, Cape Coffee Beans took off — and the rest is history.</p>
