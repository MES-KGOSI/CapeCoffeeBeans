                <p>This collection features coffees that particularly shine in the Aeropress, especially in inverted, 
                    long filter-style brews. Many also work well with other methods. The list highlights top picks,
                    though the Aeropress is versatile and many other coffees can still produce great results.</p>

                <p>This collection showcases coffees we and our roasters find exceptional in the French press.
                    Many also suit other brew methods. It‚Äôs not exhaustive absence here doesn‚Äôt mean a coffee won‚Äôt

                <p>This page highlights coffees suited for bean-to-cup machines, based on testing and feedback. 
                    Since these machines make espresso-style drinks with less control, slightly darker roasts work best, 
                    especially for milk-based beverages. Recommendations balance solubility, flavour, and customer 
                    preferences.</p>

                <p>This collection highlights coffees we enjoy as pour-overs and traditional filter brews, where paper 
                    filtration enhances their flavours. Many suit other methods too. It‚Äôs a starting point, though other 
                    unlisted coffees may also work well in filter-style brewing.</p>

                <p>Siphon brewers maintain stable temperatures and use cloth filters to produce clean, intense cups that 
                    highlight bright notes. This collection offers coffees we‚Äôve especially enjoyed in siphons, serving 
                    as suggestions rather than a complete list.</p>
