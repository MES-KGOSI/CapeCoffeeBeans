# CapeCoffeeBeans
These are the objectives achieved while building part 1 of this website using html, I have also added a Changelog.md file into my repository for more information.
# Cape Coffee Beans Website – Part 1
## Project Overview
The Cape Coffee Beans website is a professional, responsive website designed to showcase the brand’s products, brewing methods, FAQs, and contact information (Cape Coffee Beans, 2025).  
Part 1 of this project focuses on building the foundation using HTML.
The goals of Part 1 are:
- Develop a clear HTML structure for all website pages.
- Implement a consistent navigation system with logo, links, search, and cart.
- Create main content areas for each page, including headings, paragraphs, images, and links.
- Include functional forms on the Contact page.
- Organize all files and folders for easy management.
By completing Part 1, the website establishes a solid structure ready for styling (CSS) and functionality (JavaScript) in later phases.
